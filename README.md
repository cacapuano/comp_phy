# If you want to get individual graphs, run each individual file:
    # If you want to print the graph for the motion of the pendulum using Euler's method, run the following code: python pendulum_euler.py
    # If you want to print the graph for the motion of the pendulum using the fourth order Runga kutta, run the following code: python runga_kutta_method.py
    # If you want to print the graph for the motion of the pendulum using SciPy, then run the following code:
