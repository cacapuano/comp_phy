# Project 1 Submission

If you want to get individual graphs, run each individual file:
 - If you want to print the graph for the motion of the pendulum using Euler's method, run the following code: python pendulum_euler.py
 - If you want to print the graph for the motion of the pendulum using the fourth order Runga kutta, run the following code: python runga_kutta_method.py
 - If you want to print the graph for the motion of the pendulum using SciPy, then run the following code: python pendulum_scipy.py
 - If you want to find the comparison with all of the methods for the pendulum, then run the following code: python project_1_main.py

If you want to get approximate values for each method of integration to find the total work done by moving conducting sphere:
 - If you want to print the approximate value found by using the Trapezoidal method, run the following code: python trap_method.py
 - If you want to print the approximate value found by using the Simpson's rule, run the following code: python simpsons_rule.py
 - If you want to print the approximate value found by using the Riemann's method, run the following code: python riemann_method.py
 - If you want to print the approximate value found by using the SciPy package, run the following code: python integral_scipy.py
